# PyAnimation

A python library for creating 2D  animation Video

## Strategy in Brief

* To produce 2D animation Video we have to first create sequence of images(or frame) that leads to animation
* Then we will merge these frames into a video(.mp4)

## mvp video

It's not possible to embed videos directly, but you can put an image which links to a youtube video:

## Tasks

 1. Create 2D image generation Class
 2. Create 2D animation Class
 3. Create a image to video (.mp4) converter Class
 4. Create a class to add music track to the video
 5. Abstract API for Developers
 6. Documentation

## Development Rules
1. Only use Python 3 (not python 2)
2. Write clear code with comments
3. Use IDE Pycharm
4. Use less third party libs as possible
5. Use virtual environment
6. Follow Object orientation Programming approach only

## Get Started with MVP
To run MVP(Minimum Viable Product)
* First create a Virtual Environment(vnev in PyCharm)
* then clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/shubham-chhimpa/PyAnimation.git
```
* Then run following command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Now run 
```
python mvp.py
```
